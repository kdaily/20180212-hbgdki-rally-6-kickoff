<br/>

> We work to redefine how complex biological data is gathered, shared and used, redefining it through open systems, incentives, and norms.

## Our focus

> Engage <span style="color: #177bad">**diverse communities**</span> of researchers around biological and analytical problems too complex for a single institution

<br/>

> Empower <span style="color: #177bad">**citizens**</span> to track their own health and <span style="color: #177bad">**contribute**</span> deep phenotypic data to research topics important to them

## What I do @ Sage

- Community/program management and development
- Bioinformatics best practices for sharing and reproducible research
- Software development and testing
- Data analysis, genomics, statistics


## ![synapse](img/newsynapse.png)

> A platform for supporting scientific collaborations centered around shared biomedical data sets with a goal of making biomedical research more transparent, more reproducible, and more accessible to a broader audience of scientists.

## Cloud-enabled collaboration {data-transition="fade" data-background='img/clouds.jpg'}

## https://www.synapse.org/

<img src='img/synapsehome.png' width='150%'/>

> It's free!

## Projects

> A collaborative and sharable workspace for organization and description of data and analysis.

http://docs.synapse.org/articles/making_a_project.html

## Files

> Scalable, federated cloud storage for any data files

> Every file gets a unique identifier, e.g. [syn1773109](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1773109/)

Help on [files](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/files_and_versioning.html#files)

## Versioning

> Data changes over time - can update existing files without removing or overwriting them (e.g. [syn2701943.3](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2701943.3))

Help on [versioning](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/files_and_versioning.html#versioning)

## Organization

> A familiar folder hierarchy - a common way to separate files by content or access control

Help on [files and folders](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/getting_started.html#organizing-data-creating-files-and-folders)


## Organziation

<br/>

User-defined annotations enables you to search for data files<br/>across folders and projects

Adding `cellType = fibroblast` and `dataType = rnaSeq` to some files enables a search like:

> `select id from file where`
> `cellType=='fibroblast' and`
> `dataType=='rnaSeq'`

We can expose these queries in a user friendly way!

Help on [Annotation and query](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/annotation_and_query.html)

## Access control

1. **Public (anonymous)** (view)
1. **Registered** (+ download)
1. **Certified** (+ upload)
1. **Validated** (+ research)

Help on [Accounts, Certification and Profile Validation](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/accounts_certified_users_and_profile_validation.html)

## Quiz!

1. Who already has a Synapse account?
1. Who is already a certified user?

## Register

> Register at https://www.synapse.org/register

> Join PCBC Team at https://doi.org/10.7303/syn8293408


## Access control {data-background='img/share.jpg'}

> Decide who you want to share with through team and user-based sharing settings (or make it public)

Help on [teams](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/teams.html)

## Access control {data-background='img/broken_lock.jpg'}

- Data whose nature confers more than minimal risks of re-identification to the research participant.
- Genetic sequence or genotype data from living individuals
- Data from "vulnerable" populations as defined using the [Office for Human Research Protections](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/) guidelines
- Data generated with restrictions or requirements for use as outlined in informed consents or legal agreements

<span style="font-size: small">https://www.flickr.com/photos/slaunay/14506854261/</span>

## Access control {data-background='img/broken_lock.jpg'}

> Access restrictions that require reading and agreeing to terms of use or other data use agreements - may be a physical barrier (e.g., email a signed form)

Help on [Conditions for use](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/access_controls.html#conditions-for-use)

## Provenance

> The place or source of origin.
> What data or code was used to create something?

## Structured data

> Tabular data files (spreadsheets)

Example: [PCBC Cell Line Metadata (syn2767694)](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2767694/tables/)

Help on [tables](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/tables.html)

## Collaborative editing (documentation, help, readmes)

> Use text-based formatting system to author rich content describing projects, folders, and files. Can use automated solutions (like RMarkdown) as well!

Example: [Methylation data processing: syn2233188](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2233188)

## Discussions

> Threaded forum with integration to data files

[Example: Synapse Help Forum](https://www.synapse.org/#!SynapseForum:default)
